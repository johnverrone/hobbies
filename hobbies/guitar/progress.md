## Week 1 — Level 1: Fretboard Fundamentals

### 2026-02-15 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Walked through all of Level 1. Set up a recording template and workflow for tracking weekly progress.
- **How it went:** Level 1 was mostly a refresher — fretboard fundamentals, chord degrees of major and minor scales, nothing brand new yet. Enjoying Paul's teaching style and the extra resources (visuals, backing tracks) that come with the course. Even for familiar material, the presentation makes it worth the time.
- **Next session focus:**
  - Practice fretboard note recognition
  - Drill chord degrees of the major and minor scales
  - Improvise over a backing track in the key of C

### 2026-02-16 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Spent most of the session on the Level 1 solo, focusing on timing and playing cleanly. Took the Level 1 self-assessment, then moved into the beginning of Level 2 — learning all 12 major and minor triad positions on the neck.
- **How it went:** The solo is coming along but there are still tricky timing bits in the 4th bar, and the scale runs in bars 11–12 gave me trouble. Passed the Level 1 assessment and got started on Level 2 triads.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Use the metronome — playing in time needs to be a priority
  - Upgrade practice setup: office chair arms get in the way of comfortable playing
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue drilling major and minor triad positions (Level 2)
  - Revisit Level 1 solo bars 4 and 11–12 with a metronome at a slower tempo

### 2026-02-17 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Fretboard note location drills and a triad refresher. Watched the Level 2 pentatonic scales lesson and jammed over backing tracks, switching between pentatonic scale shapes to match the chord changes. Wrapped up with tempo work on Snow (RHCP) and experimenting with tones on the Nolly X plugin.
- **How it went:** The pentatonic lesson was a refresher — these shapes are familiar territory and probably my most-practiced material. The real fun was improvising over the backing track and trying to match scale positions to the underlying chords in real time. Snow is a good tempo challenge.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Improvising over chord changes with different pentatonic positions is a great way to internalize the shapes beyond muscle memory
  - Need to push beyond pentatonics — they're a comfort zone
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue Level 2 pentatonic material and chord-targeted improvisation
  - Keep working Snow up to speed with a metronome

### 2026-02-18 (2.5 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Set up Neural Amp Modeler (NAM) as a replacement for the expiring Nolly X trial. Spent a big chunk of time browsing and auditioning NAM profiles to find usable tones. Settled on a Deluxe Reverb clean with GarageBand compression and overdrive, plus a Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier high-gain profile. After dialing in tones, spent ~1 hr improvising over a self-recorded backing track using pentatonic scales. Revisited the Level 1 solo to work on speed and cleanliness.
- **How it went:** NAM is a rabbit hole — tons of community profiles and it's easy to lose track of time A/B-ing sounds. The Deluxe Reverb tone ended up being really satisfying for cleans; the Triple Rec is massive for high gain. Improvising felt good and the pentatonic shapes are becoming more automatic. The Level 1 solo is noticeably more comfortable now, even at the full 85 bpm, though bar 4 still trips me up.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - NAM is a solid free alternative to paid amp sims — worth investing time to curate a small set of go-to profiles rather than endlessly browsing
  - GarageBand's built-in drive and compressor are workable but limiting — look into better effect plugins (pedal-style VSTs?)
  - Bar 4 of the Level 1 solo is the remaining sticking point — isolate and drill it
- **Next session focus:**
  - Drill Level 1 solo bar 4 in isolation at a slow tempo, then build back up to 85 bpm
  - Continue pentatonic improvisation with the new tones
  - Start looking into dedicated compressor/drive plugins

### 2026-02-19 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Spent time throughout the day thinking about chord formulation and basic music theory. Challenged myself to identify the key of a random song by ear — ended up picking one in F# Mixolydian with a progression that doesn't start on I (D#m – F# – E – F#), which was a real puzzle. After that, went back to the Level 1 solo to try to master it. Also spent a good chunk of time dialing in the recording workflow (camera placement, file organization, color grading, audio bounce settings).
- **How it went:** The key-identification exercise was humbling — F# Mixolydian with a non-I starting chord is a tough draw for an ear training challenge. Good learning moment though. The Level 1 solo came much more naturally after a day or two off, and I finally nailed the rhythm in bar 4. Recorded a take to log progress: [Level 1 Solo Attempt](https://youtu.be/1xRSYCBZZY4?si=wg1Shqrv_l4BSXMS).
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Rest days pay off — the solo felt noticeably smoother after stepping away
  - Trying to identify keys by ear is a great exercise, even (especially) when you pick a hard one
  - Recording workflow is an investment — worth getting the process smooth now so future takes are frictionless
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue refining the Level 1 solo — clean up any remaining rough spots
  - More ear training / key identification practice with simpler songs
  - Push forward with Level 2 material

### 2026-02-21 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Started with the bending lesson from Level 2 of Next Level Playing, then dove into the Level 2 capstone solo "Feeling Blue in B Minor." Spent most of the session looping the solo to internalize the groove and nail the bends. Got a few runs in at full speed (85 bpm). Also set up Ableton Live 12 as my DAW, replacing GarageBand.
- **How it went:** The solo took a while to click but I eventually got most of it down. The bends are the crux — getting them in tune and in the pocket of the groove is the challenge. Running it at 85 bpm felt like a stretch but doable. The Ableton switch was a big upgrade: the Fender Super Reverb NAM profile paired with Ableton's built-in 'garage' reverb on the neck pickup was an incredible tone.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Ableton Live 12 is a significant step up from GarageBand — worth the switch
  - NAM Super Reverb + Ableton garage reverb on the neck pickup = chef's kiss
  - Tuning stability is becoming a real frustration — the Floyd Rose trem doesn't help, but this might just be me building a case for a new guitar (tele brain says practical, heart says strat)
- **Next session focus:**
  - Record an attempt at the Level 2 solo
  - Revisit Level 1 scales and fretboard exercises before moving to Level 3
  - Continue refining bends in the solo

### 2026-02-22 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Recorded an attempt at the Level 2 solo "Feeling Blue in B Minor" — [Level 2 Solo Attempt](https://youtu.be/mRoDcpMfwI0?si=SlZAIZ-V0iZGktKO). Then went back into the Level 2 bonus content to work on triads up the neck on the B, G, and D strings, including sus2 and sus4 chords used to voice-lead between triad positions over a C–Am–Dm–G backing track. Cooled down with noodling and scale practice.
- **How it went:** The solo recording was sloppy — bends are still horribly out of pitch and need a lot more work. The triad exercises were eye-opening but mentally taxing. Identifying every note of each triad in every position up the neck is a real brain workout — thinking in terms of chord tones and voice leading doesn't come naturally yet. The sus2/sus4 transitions between triads over the progression were a cool concept but hard to execute fluently.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Bends are the #1 thing holding the Level 2 solo back — need dedicated bend practice (pitch accuracy, not just technique)
  - Knowing the notes of triads in every position is foundational but my brain doesn't think in music theory terms yet — this will take repetition
  - Voice leading with sus2/sus4 chords connecting triads is a powerful concept worth drilling
- **Next session focus:**
  - Keep practicing Level 1 and Level 2 material before moving to Level 3
  - Dedicated bend practice — use a tuner to check pitch accuracy
  - Continue drilling triad note identification up the neck

### 2026-02-24 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Started with fretboard note recognition — picking a random note and playing major triads around every position. Completed the Level 2 bonus lesson on intervals, learning their positions relative to the root note across the entire fretboard. Nailed the ear training exercise. Started Level 3 (7th Chord Spice), learning maj7, min7, and dom7 chord shapes using barre chord voicings. Finished the session by picking up the drop D guitar and working on the intro to "Laid to Rest" by Lamb of God, using the Peavey 5150 + MSR overdrive NAM profile. Also improved the Ableton setup — created an "always monitoring" track with sends to reverb and recording tracks to avoid input monitoring issues during playback.
- **How it went:** The triad exercise is paying off — fretboard visualization is noticeably improving. The intervals lesson and ear training went well, wrapping up Level 2 cleanly. Level 3's 7th chord shapes clicked quickly with the barre chord approach, so feeling confident there. The djent/metal detour was a fun way to close out the session — the 5150 profile absolutely rips for that style. The Ableton routing fix was a quality-of-life win that should make future sessions smoother.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Fretboard knowledge is compounding — the triad + interval work is building real fluency
  - Level 2 complete (including bonus content) — ready for Level 3
  - 7th chord shapes are intuitive when built from barre chord foundations
  - The Peavey 5150 + MSR overdrive profile is the go-to for high-gain/metal tones
  - Still want a strat
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue Level 3 — deeper into 7th chord applications and exercises
  - Practice "Laid to Rest" intro — get the rhythm tighter
  - Ear training — keep building on the interval recognition foundation

### 2026-02-25 (1.5 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Learned "So Far So Fake" by Pierce the Veil. Spent the first 10–15 minutes figuring out the bass notes by ear to determine the key and chord progression — landed on D minor. The intro melody is picked rather than strummed, which made identifying the progression trickier. Found the notes for the bridge riff. After that, looked up a tutorial and learned all the remaining parts of the song.
- **How it went:** The ear training portion was a good challenge — the picked intro melody made it harder to hear the underlying chord movement, but working through it paid off. Once I had the key and bridge riff sorted, the tutorial filled in the gaps quickly and I got through all the parts in one session. The song isn't performance-ready yet — still need to dial in the tone and practice stringing all the sections together at tempo.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Ear training is getting more practical — able to identify the key and find bass notes/riffs without tab
  - Picked melodies over chord progressions are harder to analyze by ear than strummed chords
  - Learning the structure first (key, progression, riffs) before looking up a tutorial makes the tutorial way more efficient
- **Next session focus:**
  - Dial in the tone for "So Far So Fake"
  - Practice transitioning between sections at tempo
  - Continue Level 3 material
