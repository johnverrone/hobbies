## Week 1 — Level 1: Fretboard Fundamentals

### 2026-02-15 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Walked through all of Level 1. Set up a recording template and workflow for tracking weekly progress.
- **How it went:** Level 1 was mostly a refresher — fretboard fundamentals, chord degrees of major and minor scales, nothing brand new yet. Enjoying Paul's teaching style and the extra resources (visuals, backing tracks) that come with the course. Even for familiar material, the presentation makes it worth the time.
- **Next session focus:**
  - Practice fretboard note recognition
  - Drill chord degrees of the major and minor scales
  - Improvise over a backing track in the key of C

### 2026-02-16 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Spent most of the session on the Level 1 solo, focusing on timing and playing cleanly. Took the Level 1 self-assessment, then moved into the beginning of Level 2 — learning all 12 major and minor triad positions on the neck.
- **How it went:** The solo is coming along but there are still tricky timing bits in the 4th bar, and the scale runs in bars 11–12 gave me trouble. Passed the Level 1 assessment and got started on Level 2 triads.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Use the metronome — playing in time needs to be a priority
  - Upgrade practice setup: office chair arms get in the way of comfortable playing
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue drilling major and minor triad positions (Level 2)
  - Revisit Level 1 solo bars 4 and 11–12 with a metronome at a slower tempo

### 2026-02-17 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Fretboard note location drills and a triad refresher. Watched the Level 2 pentatonic scales lesson and jammed over backing tracks, switching between pentatonic scale shapes to match the chord changes. Wrapped up with tempo work on Snow (RHCP) and experimenting with tones on the Nolly X plugin.
- **How it went:** The pentatonic lesson was a refresher — these shapes are familiar territory and probably my most-practiced material. The real fun was improvising over the backing track and trying to match scale positions to the underlying chords in real time. Snow is a good tempo challenge.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Improvising over chord changes with different pentatonic positions is a great way to internalize the shapes beyond muscle memory
  - Need to push beyond pentatonics — they're a comfort zone
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue Level 2 pentatonic material and chord-targeted improvisation
  - Keep working Snow up to speed with a metronome

### 2026-02-18 (2.5 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Set up Neural Amp Modeler (NAM) as a replacement for the expiring Nolly X trial. Spent a big chunk of time browsing and auditioning NAM profiles to find usable tones. Settled on a Deluxe Reverb clean with GarageBand compression and overdrive, plus a Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier high-gain profile. After dialing in tones, spent ~1 hr improvising over a self-recorded backing track using pentatonic scales. Revisited the Level 1 solo to work on speed and cleanliness.
- **How it went:** NAM is a rabbit hole — tons of community profiles and it's easy to lose track of time A/B-ing sounds. The Deluxe Reverb tone ended up being really satisfying for cleans; the Triple Rec is massive for high gain. Improvising felt good and the pentatonic shapes are becoming more automatic. The Level 1 solo is noticeably more comfortable now, even at the full 85 bpm, though bar 4 still trips me up.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - NAM is a solid free alternative to paid amp sims — worth investing time to curate a small set of go-to profiles rather than endlessly browsing
  - GarageBand's built-in drive and compressor are workable but limiting — look into better effect plugins (pedal-style VSTs?)
  - Bar 4 of the Level 1 solo is the remaining sticking point — isolate and drill it
- **Next session focus:**
  - Drill Level 1 solo bar 4 in isolation at a slow tempo, then build back up to 85 bpm
  - Continue pentatonic improvisation with the new tones
  - Start looking into dedicated compressor/drive plugins

### 2026-02-19 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Spent time throughout the day thinking about chord formulation and basic music theory. Challenged myself to identify the key of a random song by ear — ended up picking one in F# Mixolydian with a progression that doesn't start on I (D#m – F# – E – F#), which was a real puzzle. After that, went back to the Level 1 solo to try to master it. Also spent a good chunk of time dialing in the recording workflow (camera placement, file organization, color grading, audio bounce settings).
- **How it went:** The key-identification exercise was humbling — F# Mixolydian with a non-I starting chord is a tough draw for an ear training challenge. Good learning moment though. The Level 1 solo came much more naturally after a day or two off, and I finally nailed the rhythm in bar 4. Recorded a take to log progress: [Level 1 Solo Attempt](https://youtu.be/1xRSYCBZZY4?si=wg1Shqrv_l4BSXMS).
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Rest days pay off — the solo felt noticeably smoother after stepping away
  - Trying to identify keys by ear is a great exercise, even (especially) when you pick a hard one
  - Recording workflow is an investment — worth getting the process smooth now so future takes are frictionless
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue refining the Level 1 solo — clean up any remaining rough spots
  - More ear training / key identification practice with simpler songs
  - Push forward with Level 2 material
