# Practice Plan

## Current Focus

- **Next Level Playing** course by Paul Davids (started Feb 2026, ~12 week plan)
- Working through beginner/intermediate songs to build a solid repertoire foundation
- Developing fingerpicking independence (thumb vs. fingers)
- Clean chord transitions at tempo

## Next Level Playing — Course Plan

Self-guided 7-level course. Target: Feb 2026 – May 2026 (~12 weeks).

Weekly progress recordings are saved in `guitar/recordings/` to track progression.

| Weeks | Level | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1–2   | Level 1 | Fretboard Fundamentals | |
| 3–4   | Level 2 | Triads | |
| 5–6   | Level 3 | 7 Chord Spice | |
| 7–8   | Level 4 | Chord Embellishments | |
| 9–10  | Level 5 | Dorian Domination | |
| 11    | Level 6 | Jamming like Jimi (Hendrix) | |
| 12    | Level 7 | Mixolydian Mastery | |

Adjust pacing as needed — some levels may take more or less time.

### Weekly Recording Log

Record a short clip each week to capture progress. Drop audio/video files in `guitar/recordings/` named `week-NN` (any format: `.m4a`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.mp4`).

| Week | Date | Recording | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | 2026-02-15 | | Starting the course |

## Short-term Goals

- Work through Next Level Playing Levels 1–3
- Learn 2-3 songs from the song list end to end
- Improve barre chord stamina and clarity
- Practice with a metronome consistently

## Long-term Goals

- Complete the full Next Level Playing course
- Tackle advanced songs (Little Wing, Slow Dancing in a Burning Room)
- Develop basic improvisation over blues progressions
- Build comfort with alternate tunings (Drop D, Half Step Down)

## Practice Routine

A suggested weekly structure to iterate on:

- **Daily (15-20 min)**: Warm-up exercises, chord transitions, metronome work
- **2-3x/week (30 min)**: Next Level Playing level work — watch lessons, practice exercises
- **2-3x/week (30 min)**: Focused song practice — pick one song section and drill it
- **Weekly (20 min)**: Technique focus — fingerpicking, barre chords, or lead work
- **Weekly (10 min)**: Record a progress clip and save to `guitar/recordings/`
- **Weekly (10 min)**: Review and update progress in `progress.md`
