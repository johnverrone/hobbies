# Practice Plan

## Current Focus

- Working through beginner/intermediate songs to build a solid repertoire foundation
- Developing fingerpicking independence (thumb vs. fingers)
- Clean chord transitions at tempo

## Short-term Goals

- Learn 2-3 songs from the song list end to end
- Improve barre chord stamina and clarity
- Practice with a metronome consistently

## Long-term Goals

- Tackle advanced songs (Little Wing, Slow Dancing in a Burning Room)
- Develop basic improvisation over blues progressions
- Build comfort with alternate tunings (Drop D, Half Step Down)

## Practice Routine

A suggested weekly structure to iterate on:

- **Daily (15-20 min)**: Warm-up exercises, chord transitions, metronome work
- **2-3x/week (30 min)**: Focused song practice — pick one song section and drill it
- **Weekly (20 min)**: Technique focus — fingerpicking, barre chords, or lead work
- **Weekly (10 min)**: Review and update progress in `progress.yaml`
