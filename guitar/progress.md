## Week 1 — Level 1: Fretboard Fundamentals

### 2026-02-15 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Walked through all of Level 1. Set up a recording template and workflow for tracking weekly progress.
- **How it went:** Level 1 was mostly a refresher — fretboard fundamentals, chord degrees of major and minor scales, nothing brand new yet. Enjoying Paul's teaching style and the extra resources (visuals, backing tracks) that come with the course. Even for familiar material, the presentation makes it worth the time.
- **Next session focus:**
  - Practice fretboard note recognition
  - Drill chord degrees of the major and minor scales
  - Improvise over a backing track in the key of C

### 2026-02-16 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Spent most of the session on the Level 1 solo, focusing on timing and playing cleanly. Took the Level 1 self-assessment, then moved into the beginning of Level 2 — learning all 12 major and minor triad positions on the neck.
- **How it went:** The solo is coming along but there are still tricky timing bits in the 4th bar, and the scale runs in bars 11–12 gave me trouble. Passed the Level 1 assessment and got started on Level 2 triads.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Use the metronome — playing in time needs to be a priority
  - Upgrade practice setup: office chair arms get in the way of comfortable playing
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue drilling major and minor triad positions (Level 2)
  - Revisit Level 1 solo bars 4 and 11–12 with a metronome at a slower tempo
