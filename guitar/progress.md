## Week 1 — Level 1: Fretboard Fundamentals

### 2026-02-15 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Walked through all of Level 1. Set up a recording template and workflow for tracking weekly progress.
- **How it went:** Level 1 was mostly a refresher — fretboard fundamentals, chord degrees of major and minor scales, nothing brand new yet. Enjoying Paul's teaching style and the extra resources (visuals, backing tracks) that come with the course. Even for familiar material, the presentation makes it worth the time.
- **Next session focus:**
  - Practice fretboard note recognition
  - Drill chord degrees of the major and minor scales
  - Improvise over a backing track in the key of C

- **What I worked on:** Spent most of the session on the Level 1 solo, focusing on timing and playing cleanly. Took the Level 1 self-assessment, then moved into the beginning of Level 2 — learning all 12 major and minor triad positions on the neck.
- **How it went:** The solo is coming along but there are still tricky timing bits in the 4th bar, and the scale runs in bars 11–12 gave me trouble. Passed the Level 1 assessment and got started on Level 2 triads.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Use the metronome — playing in time needs to be a priority
  - Upgrade practice setup: office chair arms get in the way of comfortable playing
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue drilling major and minor triad positions (Level 2)
  - Revisit Level 1 solo bars 4 and 11–12 with a metronome at a slower tempo

### 2026-02-17 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Fretboard note location drills and a triad refresher. Watched the Level 2 pentatonic scales lesson and jammed over backing tracks, switching between pentatonic scale shapes to match the chord changes. Wrapped up with tempo work on Snow (RHCP) and experimenting with tones on the Nolly X plugin.
- **How it went:** The pentatonic lesson was a refresher — these shapes are familiar territory and probably my most-practiced material. The real fun was improvising over the backing track and trying to match scale positions to the underlying chords in real time. Snow is a good tempo challenge.
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Improvising over chord changes with different pentatonic positions is a great way to internalize the shapes beyond muscle memory
  - Need to push beyond pentatonics — they're a comfort zone
- **Next session focus:**
  - Continue Level 2 pentatonic material and chord-targeted improvisation
  - Keep working Snow up to speed with a metronome
