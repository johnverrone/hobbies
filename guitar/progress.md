## Week 1 — Level 1: Fretboard Fundamentals

### 2026-02-15 (2 hrs)

- **What I worked on:** Walked through all of Level 1. Set up a recording template and workflow for tracking weekly progress.
- **How it went:** Level 1 was mostly a refresher — fretboard fundamentals, chord degrees of major and minor scales, nothing brand new yet. Enjoying Paul's teaching style and the extra resources (visuals, backing tracks) that come with the course. Even for familiar material, the presentation makes it worth the time.
- **Next session focus:**
  - Practice fretboard note recognition
  - Drill chord degrees of the major and minor scales
  - Improvise over a backing track in the key of C
